* Using Git

- [[https://gitbookdown.dallasdatascience.com/branching-git-branch.html][Using Branches with Git]]

- Caveats to creating a new branch, which branch you decide to start at matters, also:
   ~main~ - This will branch off your local branch on the machine itself
   ~HEAD~ - This is the current commit your working directory is pointing to /pointer to current branch/
   origin/main - the *main* branch on the remote repository (GitHub/GitLab/etc).

   Understanding which you're using is important, because you may have local changes you haven't synced to GitHub yet, etc.
