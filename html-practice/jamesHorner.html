                        including James Cameron's Titanic and AVATAR. His unique style of combining Celtic style with classical
                        orchestration and modern electronic
                        sounds created a unique style which became very successful accross the film industry. Chances are good
                        that
                        you too have seen a movie that featured
                        this artist's work, as he was very prolific in his career, composing the scores for over 100 films.
