                        What image do these two words conjure in your mind: "computer" and "history"? <br>
                        Perhaps if you're like me,
                        you think back to your family's first <i>Hewlett-Packard</i>
                        Personal Computer. A clunky, heavy, slow, noisy machine - but nonetheless state-of-the-art for its time? <br>

                        Perhaps you really know your technology and can
                        list out facts about the first Macintosh, or even ENIAC? Similarly, you probably know about the term
                        "debugging" having to do with bugs shorting out vacuum tubes,
                        long before the transistor was invented. For most people, this is what they know about computers.
                        However, as Computer Scientists we ougt to know much more about
                        the history of computing and the gradual process of iterative design that has brought us to where we are
                        today.

                         alt-text="A traditional abacus with rods and beads, displaying the numbers 1 3 5 2 9 6 4 7 0 8 below it." width="50%">
                    <p>
                        The "classical" definition of computer is: an information machine, a data processor, a problem solver,
                        an automation tool. For thousands of years, humans have been in
                        search of tools to make difficult work easier. It's no secret that humans are generally bad at math,
                        which is indeed one of the first instances we see where a "computer"
                        was invented. Meet the abacus, a handy Babalonian device with beads that made counting easier in an era
                        when not even paper, nor pencil, nor eraser yet existed.
                        Imagine yourself as a shop keeper and the novelty of owning an abacus; you no longer need to scratch
                        notes in the dirt or on wet clay in order to keep track of sales and purchases.
                        Perhaps today we take the abacus for granted, but it was nonetheless a critical development in computer
                        science as we'll see below.

                        In case you didn't know, Mathematics and Computer Science are very closely linked. The abacus was
                        significant because it was a small but crucial component in changing our understanding
                        of mathematics. As a result, the ground work was done for our future generations, once technology caught
                        up. The humble abacus contributed:

                        <!--Ordered list-->
                        <ol>
                            <li>Enhanced calculation abilities - multiplication, accurate handling of large sums.</li>
                            <li>Mathematical bases - If the abacus has 10 beads, I've suddenly invented "base 10" arithmetic.</li>
                            <li>Algorithmic thinking - I can follow a process, moving the beads along as I follow a process</li>
                            <li>Debugging - I can retrace my steps more easily</li>
                            <li>Innovation - I can be inspired to design a better abacus</li>
                        </ol>

                <p class="h-box">
                    If you explore modern computing, you'll find that entire CPU processors can be decomposed to series of
                    gates and latches which hold electrical charges
                    representing zeros and ones. Hence, this is in fact a <b>binary</b> arithmetic system. Essentially, rows
                    of beads have been replaced by silicon and electricity,
                    but the basic idea still bears resemblance to the humble abacus. Below I show a very simple adder
                    circuit, complete with animations to represent the beads, just to drive the point home.
